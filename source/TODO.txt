	I could give you some insight into why the game is the way it is.  I
worked with the two developers who created QIX when I worked for the
company that produced the board set for TAITO.

One day (around 1980?) they were in a hot tub in Calif while
experiencing the effect of a recreational synthetic and there was a
butterfly nearby.  The butterfly was the inspiration for the STIX.
Notice the traces that follow the leading edge line?  That's the way
it looked to them at the time.

If you draw a trapezoid, with the larger of the two parallel sides
considered the leading edge, the smaller of the two being the trailing
edge, and then fill the trapezoid with a half-dozen parallel, evenly
separated lines, and then remove the non-parallel sides of the
trapezoid.  When the leading edge bounces off of a surface, it follows
the new direction based on the angle of incidence.  Additionally, the
STIX will randomly change direction when it's out in the open.  There
are some characteristics of play as the game proceeds, but I don't
know if you are interested in that.
